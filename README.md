Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Raul Ceron, a passionate Systems Engineering student at San Carlos de Guatemala University, Cunori. I enjoy building innovative solutions and exploring new technologies in programming and system development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Pharmacy Management System, integrating C programming with MySQL for inventory, sales, and client management.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about serial and parallel communication and advanced database design.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software projects that combine hardware and software or involve data management systems.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my skills in artificial intelligence and system optimization techniques.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C programming, database design, or creative role-playing projects.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me via GitHub Discussions or email me at your_email@example.com.
âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m also part of a role-playing game inspired by Overlord, where Iâ€™m discovering hidden powers in a dynamic storyline.
Let's connect and build something amazing! ðŸ˜Š
